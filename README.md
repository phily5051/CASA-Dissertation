# Abstract

The increasing significance of cities in addressing climate crisis and the transition towards human-scale urban planning have brought neighbourhoods into the spotlight. The constraints imposed by pandemic-induced movement restrictions confined individuals to their immediate surroundings, underscoring the pressing need for urban transformation. In response, the concept of 15-minute city has emerged as a viable approach to reshape urban structures and create liveable neighbourhoods.

This study aimed to construct a comprehensive Liveability Index based on the principles of the 15-minute city paradigm, encompassing diversity, density, proximity, and digitalisation. The transparent development process of the Liveability Index was shared throughout the research. The final index effectively captured the intricate liveability profiles of London’s neighbourhoods. Notably, the analysis found that neighbourhoods with elevated liveability scores are generally clustered in Inner London. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the Liveability Index’s potential as a valuable instrument to guide local government urban planning policies. Additionally, the results of the Mann-Whitney U test underscored significant disparities in active travel patterns among neighbourhoods with differing liveability profiles. This emphasises the tangible impact of neighbourhood design on residents’ mobility pattern.

The assessment of neighbourhoods’ liveability through the Liveability Index can help urban planners better understand neighbourhood dynamics, enabling neighbourhood-specific actions to foster the development of diverse, walkable and liveable neighbourhoods. By providing a holistic perspective, this research contributes to the creation of urban spaces that enhance residents’ well-being and quality of life.
